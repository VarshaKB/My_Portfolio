## 🧠 Research Philosophy

This portfolio is designed as an **intellectual archive**, not a showcase of isolated projects.

Each system presented here follows three non-negotiable principles:

1. **Problem Framing Before Modeling**  
   Every project begins with reframing the business or societal problem into a mathematically and causally tractable form.

2. **Methodological Justification**  
   Models are selected based on assumptions, identifiability, and trade-offs — not popularity.

3. **Decision-Centric Outcomes**  
   Outputs are designed to influence real-world decisions, policies, or organizational strategy.

This approach mirrors **doctoral-level research workflows** while remaining grounded in deployable, production-ready systems.

## 🧩 Featured Research Case Studies

### 1. Predictive Employee Attrition & Retention Intelligence  
**Domain:** Data Science × Predictive HR Analytics  

- Reframed attrition as a **time-to-event problem** instead of binary classification  
- Implemented **Survival Analysis (Cox Proportional Hazards)** to estimate attrition risk over time  
- Applied **Double Machine Learning (DML)** to isolate causal impact of managerial interventions  
- Integrated **Transformer-based NLP sentiment signals** from employee feedback  

**Impact:**  
- ~92% predictive accuracy  
- 14.6% simulated attrition reduction  
- Built on 38,000+ structured and unstructured data points

### 2. AI-Driven Workforce Skill Graph & Internal Mobility Engine  
**Domain:** Graph Neural Networks × Strategic HR Planning  

- Designed a **Knowledge Graph** to model skill adjacency and latent talent  
- Embedded employee-role-skill relationships using **Sentence Transformers**  
- Applied **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to predict role transition feasibility  
- Optimized internal mobility decisions at enterprise scale  

**Impact:**  
- 41% increase in internal role fulfillment  
- Reduced dependency on costly external hiring  
- Scaled to 22,000+ employee profiles

## 📐 Why This Portfolio Is Different

Unlike typical portfolios that focus on dashboards or surface-level ML tasks, this archive:

- Treats **data as a system**, not a table  
- Treats **models as assumptions**, not answers  
- Treats **UX as cognition**, not decoration  

The visual language intentionally mirrors:
- Scientific instrumentation
- Signal processing metaphors
- Research archives and observatories

---

## 🌍 Multilingual & Global Orientation

- **Tamil** — Native  
- **French** — C1 (Advanced Professional Proficiency)  
- **English** — B2 (Upper-Intermediate Professional Working Proficiency)  
- **Malayalam** — B2  

Designed for **international research environments and cross-cultural teams**.

---

## 🚀 Intended Audience

This portfolio is built for:

- AI Research Labs
